These are the homework assignments I did in IUPUI's CSCI 240 class in the Fall of 2016. These are the scores I've gotten on them:

* HW1 - Pointers and Bubbles - 88/100
* HW2 - First C++ Program - 88/100
* HW3 - OOP with Horsepower - 88/100
* HW4 - Makefiles - 86/100 (excessive includes in both header file and in .cpp file
* HW5 - Parsing and File I/O - 82/100 (make run doesn't do what it's supposed to, and sum = 0 line is incorrect)
* HW6 - A Heap of Students - 86/100
* HW7 - The Perfect Pet - 36/100 (late submission)
* HW8 - Inheritance Animation - 70/100 (Code didn't work/compile)
* Project Proposal - 100/100
* Final Project - 95/100

In general, I just did the bare minimum on the assignments, hence mostly 88/100 and one 86/100.
